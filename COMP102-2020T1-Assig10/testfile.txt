This course introduces programming fundamentals, using a high level 
programming language called Java using an object oriented approach to program 
design. Students develop their programming skills by constructing 
computer programs for a variety of problems. The course provides a 
foundation for all later courses in computer science, and develops 
programming skills useful for students making applications in many other disciplines.
